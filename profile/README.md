# [FuckRKN1](https://fuckrkn1.org/#ru): Free VPN for free humans

**We** are for freedom of speech and against any kind of censorship.

**We** are making a non-commercial VPN-service that does not collect any data.

Today, freedom of speech is especially vulnerable. Independent media are banned, people are brainwashed with propaganda, VPN services are blocked, and it is dangerous to express one's position and opinion. This is the reason why we took on this project. It is non-commercial, no profit is pursued either. We are rather small, but yet, we have a great potential.

You can support us with donations or any other contribution to improve the service. Pulling requests and creating issues also helps us a lot.
